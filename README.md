## License Agreement

See [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/katahiromz/RisohEditor/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) for details of copyrights and license agreement.

## NOTICE

Please avoid installing in `"C:\Program Files"` or `"C:\Program Files (x86)"`. Because its resource compiler (`windres`) doesn't accept space character in the file path.

## Standardization

See "Standardize.md" for our standardization of resource IDs.

## FAQ

### Question 1. What is "Risoh"?

The word "risoh" means "ideal" in Japanese.

### Question 2. What are edt1, edt2, cmb1?

Those are standard control ID macros defined in `<dlgs.h>`.

### Question 3. What is mcdx?

It's a special message compiler I made. See [mcdx/MESSAGETABLEDX.md](https://github.com/katahiromz/RisohEditor/blob/master/mcdx/MESSAGETABLEDX.md) for details.

### Question 4. Why did I get garbled characters when compiling with Visual Studio?

The resource compiler of MSVC has a bug in treatment of UTF-8 resource files.

Use UTF-16 (but UTF-16 is not supported in GNU windres).

### Question 5. What is the difference between no installer and portable version?

The portable version doesn't use registry but an ini file.

### Question 6. Are the 64-bit files supported?

Yes on 64-bit Windows. However WoW64 emulation layer prevents it
loading from `"C:\Program Files"` or `"C:\Windows\system32"`.
You have to copy the 64-bit file into another place before loading.
